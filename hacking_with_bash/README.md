# Running Bash Scripts: A Quick Guide

Welcome to the "Hacking with Bash" repository! Below are instructions on how to run the Bash scripts included in this repository.

## Prerequisites

1. **Operating System**: These scripts are designed to run on Unix-like operating systems such as Linux and macOS. Some scripts may also work on Windows with the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or other Bash-compatible environments.

2. **Bash Interpreter**: Ensure that you have Bash installed on your system. Most Unix-like systems come with Bash pre-installed. You can check the version of Bash by running `bash --version` in your terminal.

3. **Permissions**: Make sure that the scripts have executable permissions. You can set executable permissions using the `chmod` command:
   ```bash
   chmod +x script_name.sh
   ```

## Running the Scripts

To execute a Bash script, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located using the `cd` command:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/directory
   ```

3. Run the script by typing its name preceded by `./`:
   ```bash
   ./script_name.sh
   ```

4. Press Enter to execute the script.

## Troubleshooting

- **Permission Denied**: If you encounter a "Permission denied" error when trying to run a script, ensure that you have set executable permissions as mentioned in the prerequisites.

- **Command Not Found**: If you receive a "Command not found" error, verify that you are in the correct directory and that the script file exists.

- **Syntax Errors**: If a script fails to run due to syntax errors, review the script code for any mistakes and ensure compatibility with your Bash version.
