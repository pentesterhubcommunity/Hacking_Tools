## Introduction

"Hacking with Python" demonstrates various hacking techniques implemented in Python. The tools provided cover a range of cybersecurity tasks, including network reconnaissance, system manipulation, cryptography, web exploitation, forensics, and exploit development.

## Prerequisites

Before running the hacking tools, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/saidehossain/hacking_with_python.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd hacking-with-python
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Linux/Mac:

      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

    - On Windows (PowerShell):

      ```bash
      .\venv\Scripts\Activate
      ```

5. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
