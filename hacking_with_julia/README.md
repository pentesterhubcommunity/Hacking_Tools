## Introduction

"Hacking with Julia" demonstrates various hacking techniques implemented in Julia. The tools provided cover a range of cybersecurity tasks, including network reconnaissance, system manipulation, cryptography, web exploitation, forensics, and exploit development.

## Prerequisites

Before running the hacking tools, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Julia**: Make sure you have Julia installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/saidehossain/hacking_with_julia.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd hacking-with-julia
    ```

3. Install the required Julia packages. You can do this by launching the Julia REPL and entering the package manager mode by pressing `]`. Then, run:

    ```julia
    activate .
    instantiate
    ```

4. Exit the package manager mode by pressing `Ctrl + C`.
