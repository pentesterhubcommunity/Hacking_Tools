## Introduction

"Hacking with R" demonstrates various hacking techniques implemented in R. The tools provided cover a range of cybersecurity tasks, including network reconnaissance, system manipulation, cryptography, web exploitation, forensics, and exploit development.

## Prerequisites

Before running the hacking tools, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **R**: Make sure you have R installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.r-project.org/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/saidehossain/hacking_with_r.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd hacking-with-r
    ```

3. Ensure R scripts have executable permissions (if necessary):

    ```bash
    chmod +x *.R
    ```
