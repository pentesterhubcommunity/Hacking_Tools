## Introduction

"Hacking with Perl" demonstrates various hacking techniques implemented in Perl. The tools provided cover a range of cybersecurity tasks, including network reconnaissance, system manipulation, cryptography, web exploitation, forensics, and exploit development.

## Prerequisites

Before running the hacking tools, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Perl**: Make sure you have Perl installed on your system. Perl is usually pre-installed on Unix-based systems. For Windows, you can download it from [here](https://www.perl.org/get.html).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/saidehossain/hacking_with_perl.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd hacking-with-perl
    ```

3. Ensure Perl scripts have executable permissions:

    ```bash
    chmod +x *.pl
    ```

## Usage

### Network Reconnaissance

- **Tool 1: Network Scanner**
  
  Description: This tool scans the network for active hosts and open ports.
  
  Usage:
  
  ```bash
  perl network-recon/network-scanner.pl
  ```

### System Manipulation

- **Tool 2: File Manipulator**
  
  Description: This tool manipulates files on the system.
  
  Usage:
  
  ```bash
  perl system-manipulation/file-manipulator.pl
  ```

### Cryptography

- **Tool 3: Encryption Tool**
  
  Description: This tool performs encryption using AES algorithm.
  
  Usage:
  
  ```bash
  perl cryptography/encryption-tool.pl
  ```

### Web Exploitation

- **Tool 4: Web Scanner**
  
  Description: This tool scans web applications for vulnerabilities.
  
  Usage:
  
  ```bash
  perl web-exploitation/web-scanner.pl
  ```

### Forensics

- **Tool 5: Disk Analyzer**
  
  Description: This tool analyzes disk images for forensic purposes.
  
  Usage:
  
  ```bash
  perl forensics/disk-analyzer.pl
  ```

### Exploit Development

- **Tool 6: Exploit Generator**
  
  Description: This tool generates exploits for security vulnerabilities.
  
  Usage:
  
  ```bash
  perl exploit-development/exploit-generator.pl
  ```
