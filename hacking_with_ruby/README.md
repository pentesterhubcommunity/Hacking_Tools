## Introduction

"Hacking with Ruby" demonstrates various hacking techniques implemented in Ruby. The tools provided cover a range of cybersecurity tasks, including network reconnaissance, system manipulation, cryptography, web exploitation, forensics, and exploit development.

## Prerequisites

Before running the hacking tools, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Ruby**: Make sure you have Ruby installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/saidehossain/hacking_with_ruby.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd hacking-with-ruby
    ```

3. Ensure Ruby scripts have executable permissions:

    ```bash
    chmod +x *.rb
    ```
