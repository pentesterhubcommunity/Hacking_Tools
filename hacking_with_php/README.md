## Introduction

"Hacking with PHP" demonstrates various hacking techniques implemented in PHP. The tools provided cover a range of cybersecurity tasks, including network reconnaissance, system manipulation, cryptography, web exploitation, forensics, and exploit development.

## Prerequisites

Before running the hacking tools, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **PHP**: Make sure you have PHP installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.php.net/downloads.php).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/saidehossain/hacking_with_php.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd hacking-with-php
    ```

3. Ensure you have a web server environment set up on your system. You can use Apache, Nginx, or any other web server that supports PHP.
